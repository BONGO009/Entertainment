		<p><em>Gangs are a symptom of low economic activity and too few education, job and entertainment opportunities.

			This might help to improve the situation:<br>

			- Enhance the standard of education in the area, make teaching fun, interesting and inspiring.<br>

			- Give communities some recreational facilities and provide funding for coaches and instructors to get kids more involved in sports after school, on weekends and during the holidays</em></p><br>

							<p><em>
								-Condition where people's basic needs for food, clothing, and shelter are not being met.<br> Poverty is generally of two types: (1) Absolute poverty is synonymous with destitution and occurs when people cannot<br> obtain adequate resources (measured in terms of calories or nutrition) to support a minimum level of physical health.<br> Absolute poverty means about the same everywhere,<br> and can be eradicated as demonstrated by some countries.<br>

						<h2>What is government doing?</h2>

<p2>“You should watch people debating about this. They never find a solution. Everyone calls for ‘Action, action!’… What action?,” said Sifiso Zitwana, letting his hands fall heavily on either side of his chair. He works for a not-for-profit  organisation, Ndifuna Ukwazi, in Cape Town.<br>

Last week the City of Cape Town, in consultation with the provincial education department and the department of community safety, launched the School Resource Officers pilot project.<br>

Six schools in the province will each be assigned a Metro police officer to “co-ordinate and improve on existing school safety initiatives”. The project will run for a year, after which it will be reviewed for roll-out to more schools.<br>

But what is being done to ensure the immediate safety of the over 60 000 pupils at Khayelitsha’s 58 schools?<br>

The South African Police Service (SAPS) says it recently launched Operation Protect Khayelitsha, which saw the additional deployment of police officers to trouble zones. It says that any “individuals or groups” who commit crime will have to face the “full force of the law”, including those younger than 18 who, despite popular community belief, will “have to face the consequences of their actions in court”.</p2>
